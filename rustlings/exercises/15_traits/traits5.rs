/*
What was the problem
item's signatures in the some_func function was undefined, leading to a syntax error

how does impl SomeTrait + OtherTrait fix this?
this means that the concrete type doesnt matter, only as long as it impliments Both Traitsn, so  both can be used later for the comparison. This is also needed, as the tests use different type combinations, therfore a single hardcoded type would fail one of them
